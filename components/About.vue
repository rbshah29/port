                Hey there! I'm a software developer who loves creating things that make life easier and more enjoyable. I've worked on all sorts of projects—web apps, mobile apps, APIs—you name it! I always aim to write clean, efficient code and design interfaces that are easy to use.

                I enjoy solving tricky problems and turning ideas into real, impactful software. Right now, I’m part of the team at <a href="https://www.evodev.ca/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500">Évodév Technologies Inc.</a>, where I get to work on cool features for different projects.

                Over the years, I’ve collaborated with companies in areas like supply chain management, open-source ERP systems, and full-stack development. I love working with others, learning new tech, and finding better ways to build awesome stuff.
            </p><br/>
            <p>
                When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me watching a new movie, bingeing a series, or diving into a good book. I’m all about creating amazing software and making a difference through tech!
