                These days, I’m part of the team at 
                <a href="https://www.evodev.ca/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500">Évodév Technologies Inc.</a>, 
                where I get to bring cool ideas to life across different projects. Nothing beats the feeling of turning a tricky problem into something people actually enjoy using.

            <p>
                Along the way, I’ve worked with companies in supply chain management, open-source ERP systems, and full-stack development. Over the years, I’ve dabbled in all kinds of projects—web apps, mobile apps, APIs—you name it. I love collaborating, picking up new tech, and always hunting for smarter ways to build awesome stuff.

                When I’m not coding, you’ll usually catch me watching movies, binging a good series, or getting lost in a book. At the end of the day, I’m all about creating software that makes a difference—while having fun doing it!

            <p>
               My goal? Keep the code clean, efficient, and the interfaces easy enough that anyone can dive right in.
