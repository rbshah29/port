                I'm a software developer who loves creating things that make life easier and more fun. I've built software applications, web apps, mobile apps, APIs, and more, always aiming for clean, efficient code and user-friendly designs. I'm also pretty good with Docker and cloud stuff.

                I enjoy solving challenging problems and turning ideas into functional, impactful software. Currently I am working as a Software developer at <a href="https://www.evodev.ca/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500">Évodév Technologies Inc. </a> where I am responsible for developing and maintaining the features for multiple projects.

                My professional background includes collaboration with various companies in sectors such as supply chain management, open-source ERP solutions, and full-stack project development. Collaboration and learning new technologies keep me inspired, and I’m always looking for ways to grow and improve—whether it’s diving into a new framework or refining existing solutions.

                When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new Movies or Series or Reading a book. I’m excited about building great software and making a difference through technology!
